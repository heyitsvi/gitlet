# Gitlet
Gitlet is a version-control system designed from scratch in Java
that mimics some features of the popular Git.

A version-control system is essentially a backup system for related collections of files. The main functionality that Gitlet supports is:

* Saving the contents of entire directories of files. In Gitlet, this is called committing, and the saved contents themselves are called commits.

* Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits. In Gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.

* Viewing the history of your backups. In Gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.

* Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.

* Merging changes made in one branch into another.
